## Overview
WDFW re-opened a popular sport fishery for winter steelhead on the Skagit River after a decade-long closure following the Endangered Species Act (ESA) listing of Puget Sound steelhead as Threatened in 2007. A [**Resource Management Plan**](https://github.com/tbuehrens/CreelAnalysis/blob/main/background/final_skagit_rmp_erd_04-10-2018.pdf) (RMP) that was jointly developed by WDFW and tribal co-managers, and adopted by NOAA Fisheries, provides the legal basis and rule set governing this fishery under the ESA. The plan ensures that impacts to wild steelhead populations from sport and tribal fisheries will not prevent the population from achieving conservation and recovery goals. The plan calls for careful monitoring of wild steelhead mortality resulting from fisheries in order to ensure that total mortality rate limits specified in the plan are not exceeded. Although current sport fishery regulations require release of wild steelhead, mortality does occur as a result of fish being caught and released, and these impacts must be quantified.

This page provides documentation of WDFW's efforts to plan and administer a fishery for Skagit steelhead that is consistent with the RMP, including:

  1) a comparison of the pre-season planned Skagit steelhead sport fishery-induced wild steelhead mortality with allowable exploitation rates designated in the Skagit steelhead RMP.
  
  2) in-season tracking of Skagit steelhead sport fishery fishery-induced wild steelhead mortality relative to allowable exploitation rates designated in the Skagit steelhead RMP.

## Pre-season Fishery Planning
This section displays the pre-season Skagit wild winter steelhead run-size forecast, the exploitation rate matrix prescribed by the Resource Management Plan, and uses the two to calculate the allowable harvest. It then compares the planned harvest (sport fishery catch * assumed catch and release mortality rate) with the allowable harvest to estimate the percent of the allowable harvest the sport fishery will use as well as the probability that the sport fishery will exceed various percentages of the allowable impacts.

First, the allowable harvest rates in the RMP are:
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,results = "asis",include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
hcr<-read_csv(file.path("data","hcr.csv"))
hcr%>%mutate(MaxRunsize=format(MaxRunsize, scientific = FALSE))%>%
  rename(`Exploitation Rate` = ER, `Minimum Run Size` = MinRunsize,`Maximum Run Size` = MaxRunsize)%>%
  kbl(caption = "Table 1. Allowable Harvest Rates, Skagit RMP ",digits =3)%>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

The run size forecast is below, and is reprinted from the co-manager agreed-to [**pre-season forecast**](https://github.com/tbuehrens/Skagit-River-Steelhead-Forecast/blob/master/analysis/App_2_Model_fitting_forecast_2020_2021_step_head_fcst.pdf). A published scientific paper describing the methods may be found here: [**(preseason forecast publication)**](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2664.13789). 

For more details on how this forecast was developed, see this [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/casruff/Skagit-River-Steelhead-Forecast), which is collaboratively maintained by tribal Co-Managers & WDFW.

### Fishery Impacts Relative to Resource Management Plan Limits: Preseason Plan
Below you will find a comparison of the the planned sport fishery catch, assuming 10 percent catch and release mortality, with the allowable harvest based on the run size forecast and the RMP mortality limits.

The allowable harvest, according to the RMP, is the number of fish that may be killed by the combined sport and tribal fisheries. However, as seen above, this number depends on the run-size, which fishery managers will not know until after the fishing season when they estimate escapement. However, based on the pre-season forecast run size, we can estimate what the true allowable harvest will be by combining the forecast run size, including its uncertainty, with the harvest rate matrix prescribed by the RMP. We can then plot the probability that the true allowable harvest will exceed a range of values. The true allowable harvest will be known with more certainty after the season when the actual run-size is known and the appropriate harvest rate from the matrix can be multiplied by the actual run size.

For example, in 2021 there is a greater than 90 percent chance that the true allowable harvest based on the true run size and the harvest matrix, will exceed 100 fish. There is a 50% chance that the allowable harvest will exceed 430 fish (10 percent of the best estimate of the run-size from the forecast), and a very small chance the allowable harvest will be greater than 2,000 fish:

Given the uncertainty in what the allowable harvest will turn out to be, managers must balance the risk of exceeding the allowable harvest with the cost of erring so heavily on the side of conservation (to ensure the allowable harvest is not exceeded) that no fishery is allowed at all. To assist with this task, managers can plan a fishery to harvest a particular number of fish (which itself may be estimated with uncertainty) and then calculate the probability that the allowable harvest will turn out to have been exceeded if the planned fishery is implemented.

For example, in 2021, a four-day a week fishery was planned with a total harvest of 76 fish (760 wild fish handled * assumed 10 percent catch and release mortality rate). This would translate to 18 percent of the allowable (sport and tribal) harvest under the RMP if the true allowable harvest is 430, at which point the exceedance probability is 50 percent. The exceedance probability is greater than 50 percent when the percentage of allowable harvest used is less than 18 percent, indicating it is more probable than not that the planned sport fishery will harvest a greater percentage of the allowable harvest. The exceedance probability is less than 50 percent when the percentage of allowable harvest used is greater than 18 percent, indicating it is more probable than not that the planned fishery will not use this much of the allowable harvest:

## In-season Fishery Results

WDFW fishery managers use data from creel surveys to estimate the season total and daily catch and effort, and the daily catch per unit effort (CPUE). Results presented below include data collected through: **`r format(as.Date(all.Dates$Date[nrow(all.Dates)]), '%m/%d/%Y')`**

### Disclaimer
Contents on this page should be treated as preliminary and are subject to change. While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of data and modeling here, some numbers may change. Particularly in-season catch and effort estimates may change as additional data becomes available, and as data errors are corrected.

### Season Total Effort and Catch 

This table and the figures below it show estimates of the season total catch and effort. Estimates are shown as 'bell curves' (though not symmetric), where the height of the curve is proportional to the probability that the true value (catch or effort) is equal to a particular value on the x-axis. The "best" estimate is the 50th percentile (median) in the table, and is denoted by the middle dashed line in the graphs:

### In-season Impact Monitoring: Fishery Impacts Relative to Resource Management Plan Limits
Here, we compare the actual in-season estimated sport fishery catch, assuming 10% C&R mortality, with the allowable harvest estimated from the forecasted run size and the RMP mortality limits, to estimate the probability that the allowable harvest has been exceeded by the actual fishery (as opposed to the pre-season plan that we looked at previously). Early in the season when little catch has occurred, the probability that the allowable harvest has been exceeded is low, but increases as the season goes on. This analyis enables an in-season quantification of risk by managers, which may be helpful in decision-making:
```{r include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Figure 9.

Vertical lines denote 50 percent of the allowable harvest, which is shared between the state and tribes, and 100 percent of the allowable harvest.
